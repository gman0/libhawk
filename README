What is it?
-----------
libhawk is a GUI-agnostic file-manager library for Linux


Building
--------
libhawk is written in C++1y so you'll need a C++1y compliant compiler
(that'd be g++ >=4.9.1 or llvm/clang >=3.5).

libhawk is using CMake build system so before you start make sure it's
installed on your system.

Dependencies (just this one)
------------
	libmagic-dev

As for the actual building:
	cd to your build directory (let's say ./build/)
	$ cd build/

	tell cmake where's the libhawk's CMake config file
	$ cmake ../src

	run make
	$ make

	(optional) now you can install libhawk to make it available
	system-wide
	# make install

Both a shared library libhawk.so and a static library libhawk_static.a will
be created.


Usage
-----
Refer to the API reference manual and hawk-test.
