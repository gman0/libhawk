What is it?
-----------
libhawk is a GUI-agnostic file-manager library for Linux


Building
--------
libhawk is written in C++11 so you'll need a C++11 compliant compiler
(that'd be g++ >=4.8.1 or llvm/clang >=3.0).

libhawk is using CMake build system so before you start make sure it's
installed on your system.

Dependencies
------------
	libboost-system-dev
	libboost-filesystem-dev
	libmagic-dev

As for the actual building:
	cd to your build directory (let's say ./build/)
	$ cd build/

	tell cmake where's the libhawk's CMake config file
	$ cmake ../src

	run make
	$ make

	(optional) now you can install libhawk to make it available
	system-wide
	# make install

A shared library libhawk.so will be created.


How do I run libhawk?
---------------------
You don't. As it's stated in the description, this is a library - it's not
capable of running as a standalone program. That's what a hawk back-end
is for (ie. hawk-gtk3).


Usage
-----
Refer to the API reference manual and hawk-gtk3.
